# depth_workshop
This is the basic workshop, to work with pont cloud data. I initially created this workshop to provide basic knowledge in the field of 3d sensor processing to the awesome team of the Child Growth Monitor Project (https://childgrowthmonitor.org/) from the Welthungerhilfe e.V.

In case you are missing something, please let me know, e.g. via an issue.  


Current content: 
1. Basics on Point Clouds and Depth Data

  * Difference between Point Cloud and Depth Image
  * Pin Hole Camera Model
  * Hands-on in tiny Notebook (https://github.com/christianpfitzner/depth_workshop/blob/master/Copy_of_depth_tutorial.ipynb)



This is just the start and we will probably continue with the following topics: 
- point cloud and rgb fusion
- calibration of depth and color sensors
